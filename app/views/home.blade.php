        <p>I'm Joel, and I'm very inspired by <a href="http://jenniferdewalt.com/">Jennifer Dewalt's</a> 180 web sites in 180 days project. I don't think I'm quite that ambitious--just a 100 day challenge. :-) This will be a playground for me to spend a little time each day experimenting with web tools and techniques (both client and server side). I'm generally only going to spend about an hour per day on these projects--it's a warm-up and test-bed more than anything, so they'll generally be pretty simple things. In some cases, I'll also revisit them when I come up with a better way to do something.</p>
